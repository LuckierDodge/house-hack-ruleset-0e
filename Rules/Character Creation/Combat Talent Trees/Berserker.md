# Berserker
* Prereq: Fighter 1
## Berserker's Rage
* Whenever you take damage, you can choose to gain the Rage condition, which grants:
	* +1 Strength, Constitution, and Will
	* -1 Wits and Finesse
* Each time you take additional damage while raging, you can gain another level of Rage without spending Stamina, up to your Fighter Level.
* The Rage condition ends if you aren't in combat and more than a minute passes without taking further damage.
* When your Rage ends, you lose a point of Stamina. If you are out of Stamina, you gain a point of Exhaustion instead.
