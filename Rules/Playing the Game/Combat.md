# Combat

During combat, each character has a limited set of Actions they can use (for most Player Characters, up to 2). Their weapons, armor, equipment, talents, and traits determine how they can spend these actions.

Each Round of combat is divided into 2 phases: _Action Declaration_ and _Action Resolution_. In the _Action Declaration_ phase, each character declares the actions they intend to take. In the _Action Resolution_ phase, each of the declared actions is resolved.

## Movement

Every player has a default speed, measured in squares (each square corresponds to about 1.5 meters). They can spend an action to **Move**, moving up to their speed. They can use this action up to 2 times in a round.

## Weapon Attacks

* Roll the Weapon's listed **Characteristic Die**. The result is your **Attack Value**.
* If your **Attack Value** beats their **Defense Value** you do damage equal to the weapon's Damage plus your **Characteristic Value**.
* Proficiency with a Weapon improves the **Characteristic Die** you roll by 1 per level. So if you have a d6 **Characteristic Die** and **Proficiency** 2 with a weapon, you increase it to a d10.
* **Advantage** allows you to roll one additional die and choose the higher. **Disadvantage** allows you to roll one additional die and take the lower. **Advantage** and **Disadvantage** both stack and cancel out.

### Aim

If wielding a ranged or thrown weapon, like a Bow or Javelin, you can choose to take the Aim action. This grants **Advantage** with the next attack you make with that weapon before the end of the next round. This does not count as using a weapon for the purpose of multiple actions in a round (i.e. you can aim and attack in the same turn).

### Unarmed Attacks

* If you have a free hand, you can make a **Physical Power**-based **Weapon Attack** against a target of your choice. This has Speed 1 and Bludgeoning 0 by default.

## Defensive Actions

* For each time you take a **Defensive Action**, such as a **Block**, **Parry**, or **Dodge**, you can potentially avoid the damage of one incoming attack.
* Each **Defensive Action** gives you a **Defense Value**. If multiple attacks target you during the same turn, you must choose which **Defense Value** applies to which attack.
* Any attacks against which you don't take an explicit **Defensive Action** will automatically hit, and are only reduced by the amount of your DR.
* **Proficiency**, **Advantage**, and **Disadvantage** work in the same way as they do for **Weapon Attacks**.

### Block

* Shields and certain talents or traits grant you access to the **Block** action.
* A **Block**'s **Defense Value** is determined by rolling the corresponding **Characteristic Die**.
* Unlike **Parry** or **Dodge**, a single block value may be used against more than one incoming attacks. How many depends on the Item, Talent, or Trait granting the Block.

### Parry

* Certain weapons grant the **Parry** action.
* A **Parry**'s **Defense Value** is determined by rolling the corresponding **Characteristic Die**.
* A **Parry** can only defend against one attack.

### Dodge

* Any character that isn't **Immobilized** can take the **Dodge** action.
* A **Dodge**'s **Defense Value** is determined by rolling **Physical Finesse**.
* You can use the **Dodge** action as many times per Round as you have actions available.
* A single **Dodge** can only be applied to one attack.

## Armor and Damage Reduction

* Armor, as well as some Talents and Traits, provide Damage Reduction (DR). DR reduces the amount of damage taken from attacks, to a minimum of 1.

## Stamina

Every Player Character, and many Non-Player Characters, have a certain amount of a resource called **Stamina**. This is a resource that regenerates between fights, and can be spent in a variety of ways during combat.

* Certain Talents and Traits grant abilities that require **Stamina** to use.
* **Stamina** can be spent to gain **Surges**.

### Surges

A **Surge** allows for a character to gain an extra action during a given round. Only one **Surge** can be used per round, and a **Surge** can be declared at any time during either the action declaration or resolution phases of combat. A **Surge** can not be used to take an Action using an item that has already been used a number of times equal to its **Speed**

## Attacking or Defending Multiple Times in a Single Round

In general, you may only use a single item to attack or defend a number of times during a round equal to its **Speed**. If you are using a weapon for two or more different actions during a single round, use the smallest of the speeds.

If you are wielding multiple items, the Speed applies individually for each Item.
