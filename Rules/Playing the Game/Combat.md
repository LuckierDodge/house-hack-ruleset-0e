# Combat
## Weapons
* Attack: d20 + Strength/Finesse + Melee/Ranged Skill Rank + Weapon Specialization Skill Rank
* Defense: 10 + Agility
* Critical Hit: Bypass Resistance
* Two Handing: Double your Strength/Finesse
## Armor
* Armor provides Resistance against any attack that doesn't explicitly bypass it, at the cost of reduced Agility, Speed, Finesse, and Awareness.
	* More protective armor grants greater Resistances, but also larger penalties.
* The result is that characters with Heavy Armor are less maneuverable and easier to hit, but will take less (and sometimes no) damage from certain attacks that do land.
* Shields provide varying degrees of Cover, increasing the wielder's Agility Defense at the cost of Finesse.
* Rule of thumb: For every point of Resistance a piece of standard armor provides, it should provide an equivalent penalty to Agility, Finesse, or Awareness.

### Death's Door
* If at 0 Durability or 10 Exhaustion, you are considered at Death's Door
* Every time you take Damage or gain Exhaustion while at Death's Door, roll a DC10 CON save (unaffected by Exhaustion levels). On a failure, your character dies.
## Initiative
Each character acts in order of Agility. Ties are broken by opposing d20 roll.
## Actions
* Every Character has 1 Action
* An Action can be used to attack, cast a spell, pull something from a pack, or any other activity that could be reasonably completed in a short period of time (5-10 seconds)
* Characters can also **Multitask**, doing 2 actions at once (attacking two different targets, sheathing a weapon and then drawing and attacking with another), but have disadvantage on any rolls.
* Characters can also move up to their speed, regardless of other actions, without Multitasking.
### Move
* You can move up to your speed on every turn
### Sprint
* You can move up to your speed again
### Defend
* You focus on Defense rather than offense
* You can add your Dodge (if not immobilized) and Parry (if holding a melee weapon) Skill ranks to your Reflex Defense until the start of your next turn.
### Attack
* Make a weapon or spell attack against an enemy
* Ranged or Melee
