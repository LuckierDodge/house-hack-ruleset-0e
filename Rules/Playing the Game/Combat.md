# Combat

During combat, each character has a limited set of Actions they can use each round. They also get 1 Free move per turn. Their weapons, armor, equipment, talents, and traits determine how they can spend these actions.

## Initiative

Each side involved in a combat rolls a d20, rerolling on ties. If either side has bonuses to their groups Initiative, they can add those to the roll. The Initiative then proceeds in order from highest to lowest, with each side having the opportunity to act.

Each time a side takes the Initiative, each of its members can take their actions in whatever order they deem appropriate (including interleaving actions).

## Movement

Every player has a default speed, measured in squares (each square corresponds to about 1.5 meters). Most PCs have a default Move Speed of 4. They can spend an action to **Move**, moving up to their speed.

Characters get 1 Free Move Action per round.

## Health and Morale

* You have Morale equal to 5 + **Mental Resilience** times your Level.
* You have Health equal to 5 + **Physical Resilience**.
* Unless specified otherwise, damage is first applied to your Morale. Damage that reduces your Morale to 0 does not roll over to Health, and Morale can't be negative.
* If your Morale is at 0, you suffer a **Disadvantage** on all checks, and future damage is applied to Health.
* If your Health is at 0, you are unconscious. If you reach negative Health equal to your maximum Health, you are dead.


## Weapon Attacks

* Roll the Weapon's listed **Characteristic Die** and add the Weapon's Base Damage. The result is your **Threat Value**.
* If your **Threat Value** beats their **Defense Value** you do damage equal to the difference
* **Advantages** allows you to move up the dice ladder (increasing the size of the die). **Disadvantages** move your die down the dice ladder (decreasing the size of the die). **Advantage** and **Disadvantage** can both stack with themselves, and cancel each other out.
* **Proficiency** with a Weapon, Tool, or Technique allows you to roll twice and take the higher.
* For each attack you make in a round after the first, you take an accumulating disadvantage penalty. For example, your second attack has one disadvantage, your third has two, and so forth

### Aim

If wielding a ranged or thrown weapon, like a Bow or Javelin, you can choose to take the Aim action. This grants an **Advantage** with the next attack you make with that weapon before the end of the next round. This does not count as using a weapon for the purpose of multiple actions in a round.

### Unarmed Attacks

If you have a free limb, you can make a **Physical Power**-based **Weapon Attack** against a target of your choice. This has base damage of Bludgeoning 0 by default.

### Dual Wielding

If wielding a weapon in your off hand one or more size categories smaller than your character, you can spend an action to gain advantage on your attack with the weapon in your primary hand.
### Two-handed Melee Weapons

If wielding a melee weapon with both hands, you gain an advantage on the attack.

## Defensive Actions

* If you are attacked while not incapacitated or surprised, you have the opportunity to take **Defensive Action**, allowing you to potentially reduce or eliminate the damage from an attack. You can spend **Surges** (see below) to take multiple **Defensive Actions** in response to an attack.
* Whenever attacked, you have the chance to **Dodge**. Roll **Physical Finesse**, and reduce the Threat of the attack by the result.
* If you have a shield you can choose to **Block**. Roll **Physical Resilience**, reducing the Threat of the attack by the result.
* If you have a weapon that can **Parry**, you can roll **Physical Power** and reduce the Threat of the attack by the result. Note that **Parry** has 3 Disadvantage against ranged attacks.

## Armor and Damage Reduction

* Armor, as well as some Talents and Traits, provide Damage Reduction (DR). DR reduces the amount of damage taken from any attack that successfully hits, to a minimum of 1.
* If you aren't proficient with the Armor you're wearing, you only gain half of the DR benefit, and suffer an additional -1 Move Speed penalty.

## Stamina

Every Player Character, and many Non-Player Characters, have a certain amount of a resource called **Stamina**. This is a resource that regenerates between fights, and can be spent in a variety of ways during combat:

* Certain Talents and Traits grant abilities that require **Stamina** to use.
* **Stamina** can be spent to gain **Surges**. A **Surge** allows for a character to gain an extra action during a given round. Only one **Surge** can be used per round, and a **Surge** can be declared at any time during either the action declaration or resolution phases of combat.
	* You can recover 1 **Stamina** by taking the **Recover** action. You can take this action once per round (you cannot take this action and use a **Surge** in the same round).

## Conditions

* Burning
	* A Burning creature or object takes an amount of Fire damage equal to the level of Burning, evaluated at the start of the creature or object's turn. Unless actively exposed to a continual source of Burning, like a fire, hot magma, or molten metal, the condition has Diminish 1 and can additionally be reduced by 1 for each action spent extinguishing.

## Condition Properties

* Diminish
	* A condition with the Diminish property has its level reduced by the Diminish Level each time its effect is evaluated.
