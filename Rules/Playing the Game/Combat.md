# Combat

During combat, each character has a limited set of Actions they can use each round. They also get 1 Free move per turn. Their weapons, armor, equipment, talents, and traits determine how they can spend these actions.

## Initiative

Each side involved in a combat rolls a d20, rerolling on ties. If either side has bonuses to their groups Initiative, they can add those to the roll. The Initiative then proceeds in order from highest to lowest, with each side having the opportunity to act.

Each time a side takes the Initiative, each of its members can take their actions in whatever order they deem appropriate (including interleaving actions).

## Movement

Every player has a default speed, measured in squares (each square corresponds to about 1.5 meters). Most PCs have a default Move Speed of 4. They can spend an action to **Move**, moving up to their speed.

Characters get 1 Free Move Action per round.

## Health and Morale

* You have Morale equal to your **Mental Resilience** times your Level (minimum 1).
* You have Health equal to your **Physical Resilience** plus your Level.
* Unless specified otherwise, damage is first applied to your Morale. Damage that reduces your Morale to 0 does not roll over to Health, and Morale can't be negative.
* If your Morale is at 0, you suffer a **Disadvantage** on all checks, and future damage is applied to Health.
* If your Health is at 0, you are unconscious. If you reach negative Health equal to your maximum Health, you are dead.


## Weapon Attacks

* Roll the Weapon's listed **Characteristic Die**. The result is your **Threat Value**.
* If your **Threat Value** beats their **Defense Value** you do damage equal to the weapon's Base Damage plus your **Characteristic Value**.
* **Advantages** allows you to move up the dice ladder (increasing the size of the die). **Disadvantages** move your die down the dice ladder (decreasing the size of the die). **Advantage** and **Disadvantage** can both stack with themselves, and cancel each other out.
* **Proficiency** with a Weapon, Tool, or Technique allows you to roll twice and take the higher.

### Aim

If wielding a ranged or thrown weapon, like a Bow or Javelin, you can choose to take the Aim action. This grants **Advantage** with the next attack you make with that weapon before the end of the next round. This does not count as using a weapon for the purpose of multiple actions in a round.

### Unarmed Attacks

If you have a free limb, you can make a **Physical Power**-based **Weapon Attack** against a target of your choice. This deals Bludgeoning 0 + your **Physical Power** by default.

### Damage

* If you hit with a Melee Weapon Attack, your damage is equal to the Weapon's Base Damage, plus your **Physical Power Value**.
* If you hit with a Ranged Weapon Attack, your damage is equal to the Weapon's Base Damage, plus your **Physical Finesse Value**.

### Dual Wielding.

When attacking while wielding two weapons a size category smaller than you or smaller, you can make two attacks in a round, one with each weapon.

### Two-handed Melee Weapons

If wielding a melee weapon with both hands, you gain an advantage on the attack and deal double your **Physical Power** in Damage.

## Defensive Actions

* If you are attacked while not incapacitated or surprised, you have the opportunity to take **Defensive Action**, allowing you to potentially reduce or eliminate the damage from an attack.
* Whenever attacked, you have the chance to **Dodge**. Roll **Physical Finesse**, and if the result is higher than the **Threat** of the attack, you take no damage.
* If you have a shield you can roll to **Block** in addition to **Dodge**. Roll both your **Physical Finesse** and **Physical Resilience**, taking the higher of the two values.
* If you have a weapon that can **Parry**, you can roll **Physical Power** in addition to your **Dodge**'s **Physical Finesse**, taking the higher of the two values.

## Armor and Damage Reduction

* Armor, as well as some Talents and Traits, provide Damage Reduction (DR). DR reduces the amount of damage taken from any attack that successfully hits, to a minimum of 1.
* If you aren't proficient with the Armor you're wearing, you only gain half of the DR benefit, and suffer an additional -1 Move Speed penalty.

## Stamina

Every Player Character, and many Non-Player Characters, have a certain amount of a resource called **Stamina**. This is a resource that regenerates between fights, and can be spent in a variety of ways during combat:

* Certain Talents and Traits grant abilities that require **Stamina** to use.
* **Stamina** can be spent to gain **Surges**. A **Surge** allows for a character to gain an extra action during a given round. Only one **Surge** can be used per round, and a **Surge** can be declared at any time during either the action declaration or resolution phases of combat.
	* You can recover 1 **Stamina** by taking the **Recover** action. You can take this action once per round (you cannot take this action and use a **Surge** in the same round).

## Attacking or Defending Multiple Times in a Single Round

In general, you may only use a single item to attack a number of times during a round equal to its **Speed**. If you are using a weapon for two or more different actions during a single round, use the smallest of the speeds.

If you are wielding multiple items, the Speed applies individually for each Item.
