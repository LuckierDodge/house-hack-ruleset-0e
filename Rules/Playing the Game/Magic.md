# Magic

Wielders of magic have, either through intense study or innate power, gained the ability to manipulate reality by harnessing the Unseen World. There are many types and sources of magic, but we provide some examples below.

## Casting Spells

* A Mage can cast a spell by combining **Arcane Lemmas**. You will find a list of some examples below.
* Whenever a Mage invokes magic, it costs at least 1 **Aether**
* A Mage can normally only cast spells if they have at least one free hand and can speak clearly.
* When combining **Lemmas** to cast a spell, the total **Aether** cost is calculated by multiplying the cost of each together. The casting time, on the other hand, is equal to the cost of the longest part.
* Every Mage has a **Range of Influence**, the distance (in squares) around them in which they can enforce their will on reality. This is equal to 1 + **Mental Power**

## Arcane Lemmas

### Damaging Lemmas

* **Lance**
    * Aether: 1
    * Components: a straight implement of at least Medium size, like a staff, spear, or metal rod.
    * Time: 2 Actions
    * A perfectly straight line of arcane power strikes out in a direction of your choosing, with length equal to your **Range of Influence**.
    * Damage: Roll **Mental Finesse** + **Mental Power** value as Force Damage
* **Bolt**
    * Aether: 1 per bolt
    * Components: a wand.
    * Time: 1 Action
    * You throw a bolt of arcane energy at targets within your **Range of Influence**.
    * Damage: Roll **Mental Finesse** + **Mental Power** value as Force Damage
* **Ball**
    * Aether: 1 x the Radius in Squares
    * Components: a spherical crystal orb
    * Time: 2 Actions
    * You concentrate on a point within your **Range of Influence**, and an explosion emanates out from it, engulfing anything in a sphere of radius equal to the amount of Aether expended.
    * Damage: Roll **Mental Finesse** + **Mental Power** value as Force Damage

### Elemental Lemmas

* Fire
    * You have learned the secret words and symbols for Fire in the Lingua Arcana, gaining the following abilities
    * Manipulate Fire
        * Aether: 1 for every square cube of fire being manipulated
        * Components: A piece of Phosphor or Sulphur
        * Time: 1 Action
        * You can manifest magical Fire, or manipulate existing flames within a 1 square cube per Aether expended. You might, for example, extinguish or light a torch, candle, or campfire, move a flame from one surface to another, or make a flame dance or form an image according to your desire.
    * Fire Damage
        * Aether: 2
        * Components: A piece of Phosphor or Sulphur
        * Time: 1 Action
        * You can replace the damage type of a damaging spell or lemma with Fire Damage.
        * If you cast a damaging spell using this Lemma, any flammable creatures or objects hit must roll a **Physical Resilience** test. If they do not exceed the damage, they gain **Burning** levels equal to the damage, with **Diminish** 1.
