# Magic

Wielders of magic have, either through intense study or innate power, gained the ability to manipulate reality by harnessing the Unseen World. There are many types and sources of magic, but Player Characters hoping to harness the Arcane powers and manipulate the **Aether** within can mostly rely on the rules below.

## Wielding the Arcane

There are generally 3 ways a Player Character might harness arcane magic to influence the world:

1. Spells: carefully crafted arcane arts, perfected by the work of many skilled mages across the eons.
2. Cantrips: combining various magical **Lemmas** on the fly, cantrips are versatile magics that can be constructed to suite the situation. They consist of up to 3 parts.

	* Form Lemma: the form the magic takes.
	* Source Lemma: determines the type of energy manifested by the cantrip.
	* Modifier Lemma: adds additional effects to the cantrip.

3. Rituals: time consuming and often resource intensive, rituals can be performed by even those unable to manipulate the **Aether** directly.

* A Mage can normally only cast spells if they have at least one free hand and can speak clearly.
* Magic is complex, and requires great skill to wield. Casting Magic requires rolling a Spell Check, with a Target Number determined by the spell being cast. More Powerful (and thus more complex) spells have higher Target Numbers. Failing a Cast Magic roll results in the spell failing to take effect. Critical Failure results in a Spell Mishap. If the spell is an Attack, the Cast Magic roll is also the Attack value.
* When combining **Lemmas** to cast a cantrip, the difficulty is calculated by adding the cost of each **Lemma** together. The casting time, on the other hand, is equal to the longest **Lemma**.
* Every Mage has a **Range of Influence**, the distance (in squares) around them in which they can enforce their will on reality. This is determined by their **Will** (minimum 1)

| Manipulate Fire | 5 per square cube of fire | A piece of Phosphor or Sulphur | 1 Action | For as long as you can maintain focus, you manifest or manipulate flames within 1 square cube per Aether expended.

If you stop concentrating on the flames, they dissipate unless they've ignited something and have fuel to burn. | -      |
