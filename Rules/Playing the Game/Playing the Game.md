When your character is **Tested**, you make a roll and compare it to the **Test Difficulty** determined by the GM. If your are in a **Contest**, you each roll and compare results to determine the outcome.

`Test Result = Characteristic Die + Circumstance Die`

## Characteristic Die

The size of this Die is determined by the Characteristic being tested.

## Circumstance Die

* The size of this die is determined by the circumstances. Advantages, Disadvantages, Tools, Traits, and Proficiencies all contribute to the size of this die.
* By default, this die is a d6.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Some abilities, effects, or circumstances might affect how likely a character is to succeed on a given test. These affects grant either **Advantage** or **Disadvantage**. **Advantage** allows you to increase the Circumstance die being rolled one step on the Dice Ladder, while **Disadvantage** requires you to decrease the Circumstance die one step down the Die Ladder. **Advantage** and **Disadvantage** stack with themselves and cancel each other out.
