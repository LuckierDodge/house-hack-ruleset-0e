# Magic, Miracles, and Powers

### Casting, Channeling, and Manifesting
* Casting, Channeling, and Manifesting costs Stamina.
* Casting a Spell, channeling a Miracle, or manifesting a Psionic Power other than one granted by a Talent requires a successful spellcasting/channeling/psionics check, which is also compared to the relevant defense of any targeted character or object.
* On a Critical Failure, you suffer a Catastrophe determined by the GM.
* Spells, Miracles, or Powers explicitly granted by Talents can't trigger a Catastrophe, though they may still require a check to determine whether they take effect
* Damaging spells and powers have a Damage Pool, which is divided up evenly when there are multiple targets
	* Damage Pool: Damage Di(c)e + Characteristic (typically Wits, Will, Intuition, or Constitution) + Spellcasting/Psionic Skill Rank + Magic/Power Type Skill Rank
* For instance, to use Psionic Telekinesis to hit someone with a rock
	* Roll d20 + Will + Psionics Skill + Telekinesis Skill
	* If it hits, deal damage equal to 1d(Damage Die) + Will + Psionics Skill + Telekinesis Skill
* Spellcasting/psionics tests have a DC determined by the GM. For simple tasks where failure isn't a risk (e.g. lighting a candle in your hand), the GM shouldn't call for a roll, and the use should probably not consume Stamina.
