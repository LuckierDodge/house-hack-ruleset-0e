# Core Rules
## Rolls
* Roll d20 + Mods
* Rolling a 1 on a d20 decreases the degree of success by 1.
* Rolling a 20 on a d20 increases the degree of success by 1.
* Qualified Success: when a roll is a Failure but not a Critical Failure, the GM can offer a Qualified Success, allowing the character to at least partially succeed, but typically at the cost of some complication or cost. If they decline, the normal conditions of a Failure occur.

| Roll                    | Degree of Success |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| 10 or more below Target | Critical Failure  |
| 1 to 9 below Target     | Failure           |
| 0 to 9 above Target     | Success           |
| 10 or more above Target | Critical Success  |

## Skills
* Having Skill Ranks in a Skill grants a bonus to rolls related to that skill. At the end of each session, you can increase your Rank in a Skill used during that session by 1. You can't increase any single skill above your Player Level.
* You can gain ranks in a number of skills equal to your Level + the higher of Wits or Intuition.
* Casting has 2 relevant Skill Ranks for each check: your overall Spellcasting, Channeling, or Psionics skill, respectively, and a skill for the specific type of magic, miracle, or power being harnessed (Fire, Illusions, Telepathy, Charms, etc). You must have at least one skill rank in a type of magic or power to cast that magic.
* Similarly, Weapons have 2 relevant Skill Ranks for each check: a general Melee or Ranged Skill, and a specific Weapon Skill.
## Stamina
* You have an amount of maximum Stamina equal to 2 * Level
* Stamina is spent during Adventures and regained during Interludes, representing the accumulating stress, wear, and tear of journeying beyond safety and comfort and facing off against what lies beyond.
* You can regain 1 Stamina or remove 1 level of Exhaustion per full night's rest.
* Stamina has two uses:
	* Stamina can be consumed to recover Durability outside of combat.
	* Stamina can be spent to gain the benefits of certain Talents, and to cast Spells, channel Miracles, or manifest Powers
	 * If you are out of Stamina, you can still use features that require Stamina, but you instead accumulate Exhaustion (-1 to all rolls, defenses, and movement speeds) until your next Interlude.
	  * At 10 Exhaustion, your character is at Death's Door.
   ## Destiny
   * During Character Creation, a character chooses a Destiny for their Character
   * Whenever the GM determines the character has made significant progress towards their Destiny, they gain a Destiny point.
   * Destiny points can be spent to automatically treat any single roll the Player makes as if it were a Natural 20, or a roll made against the character as if it were a Natural 1.
   * Each Character can only have a single Destiny Point at a time.
   ## Inspiration
   * When a character rolls a Natural 20, the character gains an Inspiration Point.
   * Whenever an ally that can see or hear that character makes a roll, the Party Member can spend that Inspiration Point to Inspire the ally, granting them advantage.
   * Each character can have at most a single Inspiration Point at a time.
