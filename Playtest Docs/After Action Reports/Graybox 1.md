# Graybox 1 AAR

Author: Ryan

## Playtest Details

* GM: Ryan
* Players:
	* Matt as Beowarn (Fighter)
	* Kevin as Cassius (Cleric)
* Scenario:
	* Goblin Ambush
	* 4 Goblins attack player party alongside forested road.

## The Good

* Opposing rolls were quick and easy. It was nice to roll, find the highest number, and report without any arithmetic
* Characteristics feel really good though they didn't come up much.
* Advantage mechanic felt good, handled stuff like the interaction between long range and aiming well.
* Damage felt surprisingly balanced in this scenario, with roughly one Goblin per turn killed.
* Stamina seemed to hold up well as an "oh, I really want to do a thing" button.

## The Bad

* Autodamage if a target wasn't defending or had exhausted defenses felt unsatisfying/punishing
* Totally forgot about the Hit and Run feature, and I'm not sure it'd be useful to begin with.
* Not enough tactical options: players mostly defaulted to just standing in the open, trading blows/shots
* A few too many thorny edge cases for Initiative Free Combat to handle. We'd probably need to sacrifice too much in other areas in order to streamline it enough to work.
* Missing as a null action feels kinda bleh. Just "I rolled a 6", "Sorry, they rolled an 8, no luck" was kinda eh?
* Flat damage was kinda underwhelming, though simple to adjudicate.

## Recommendations

* Abandon Initiative Free in favor of a Side Initiative scheme
* Static/Default Defense that taking defensive actions augments.
* Need mechanic that allows you to move up the Dice Ladder. What can a player do to make their d6 a d8? (Maybe spend a resource like Stamina?)
* Add more robust support for combos and players directly working together, probably through dice pools, and encourage them to move around more and diversify actions.
* Coming back around to "damage as the difference between attack and defense". Probably should do something like Difference in Dice + Base Weapon Damage. Maybe a little arithmetic is okay.
