# Escape From the Goblin Caverns

## Slave Pens

The player characters, either citizens or visitors of the town of Tellatoll, have been dragged off in the night by Goblin Slavers, and find themselves unceremoniously deposited in a dank cave, heads covered, hands bound and placed within a shoddily constructed wooden cage. They are generally unharmed.

The goblin slaver party that delivered you takes the hoods off and makes to leave, raucous clamoring and chattering in their native tongue slowly fading as they move along the passageway. A lone goblin stands watch outside the cages, armed with a wicked looking knife.

Unbeknownst to the Watch Goblin, the cage isn't properly latched, and the door can be pushed open. This, along with a number of sharp points which could be used to cut their bonds, can be spotted by a perceptive player with an Intuition test.

If the players go long enough without doing something to attract his attention, the watch goblin will fall asleep.

## Stockpiles

The goblin stockpiles consist of haphazard piles of weapons, food, and supplies pillaged from towns and travelers.

Players can find:

* Goblin Daggers, Clubs, Short Bows, and Spears
* 2 Wands that a magical caster can use as a focus
* Bandages, which can be used to Tend Wounds (Finesse Check 50 to recover 1d10 Condition lost from wounds).
* A +15/2d10 Poison Vile, which can be used to coat a weapon.
* Some dry rations and waterskins.
