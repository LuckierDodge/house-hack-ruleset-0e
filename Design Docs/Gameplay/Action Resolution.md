# Action Resolution

## The Action Queue

An _Action Queue_ is a list (either mental, analog, or digital) of what each character is doing in a scene. This isn't always necessary (for instance, you don't need to build an AQ while the entire party is engaged in a conversation with each other or an NPC), but should be used whenever multiple players or NPCs are acting independently, to establish what each is doing simultaneously.

Building an Action Queue is straightforward, and should be done whenever a Player or NPC starts to take an action, and you the GM want to know what everyone else is doing either independently or in-response to that action. Note that the trigger there is "starts" to take an action. When a Player says "my character stabs the enemy", the rest of the players and NPCs are responding to the Player's character drawing their sword and preparing to strike. The actual stabbing may or may not occur, depending on how the other characters in a scene respond and any Tests involved.

1. Write down any previously declared actions, especially the triggering action. Make sure to clarify any vague or unclear action declarations. Summarize the situation for the players and telegraph the actions of any NPCs.
2. Proceed around the table, giving each player an opportunity to declare the action(s) they'd like to take. "I do nothing", "I stand back and watch", and "I wait" are all valid actions.
3. Resolve the Action Queue in a logical order. This shouldn't necessarily be in the order of declaration, but rather in the logical timeline of the world. In other words, quicker actions should be resolved before slower actions. Don't be afraid to modify the action queue as characters react to changing situations or the resolutions of other actions in the queue.
4. Refill the queue with Action Declarations as needed. If one action takes longer than all the others to resolve, describe the progress on the long running action and then get new action declarations from the other players.

## Combat

### Action Economy

* During Combat, characters have 2 Action Points to spend per round.
* A round consists of 2 Phases.

### Resolving a Phase

* Roll initiative and proceed from highest to lowest, giving each Character a chance to declare an action.
	* If a Character declares a Single AP Action, resolve it immediately.
	* If a Character declares a multiple AP action, make a note of the action and mark 1 AP of progress towards it.
* If a Character had previously declared a Multiple AP action, they can choose to continue the action or abort it.
	* If they continue it, mark another AP of progress. If the progress now equals the number of AP necessary to complete the action, resolve it.
	* If they abort it, they can declare a new action, but lose any AP previously spent on the action.

## Examples of Action Costs

* 1 AP: Quick Weapon Strikes, Short Movement, General Object Interactions
* 2 AP: Heavy Weapon Attacks, Powerful spells
