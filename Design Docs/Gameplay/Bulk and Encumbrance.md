# Bulk and Encumbrance

Rather than a weight-based Encumbrance system, which involves a lot of fiddly math and "how much does an Ogre's head weigh?", I propose a Bulk encumbrance system.

Characters can carry 2 + _Physical Power_ Bulk without penalty. Add or reduce this number by 5 per size category above or below Medium. Each additional Bulk above that results in the following:

* A -1 penalty to Physical Power and Finesse checks, and reduce movement speed by 1 square
* +1 Exhaustion for each hour spent carrying the extra bulk
* Add 25% to overland travel times.

| Size                    | Base Bulk |
| ----------------------- | --------- |
| Fine, Diminuitive, Tiny | 0         |
| Small                   | 1         |
| Medium                  | 2         |
| Large                   | 4         |
| Huge                    | 8         |
| Gargantuan              | 16        |
| Colossal                | 32        |

* To calculate the bulk for any given item, start with the Base Bulk for the size of the object above.
	* If an object is made of an especially dense or light material, either add or subtract Bulk
	* If the object is especially long or thin, such that it doesn't occupy much of the volume described by its size category, consider dividing its bulk by a factor of 2 or, for especially long or thin objects, even 3.
* Groups of 0-bulk items become 1 bulk items. A good rule of thumb is 10 per. I.e. 10 arrows counts as 1 Bulk, 10 candles, etc.
* Certain objects, like backpacks, pouches, and the like, can offset the bulk of items they carry, allowing characters to carry additional bulk.
* Certain objects, like armor or polearms, have their Bulk reduced when equipped, as they are much more cumbersome when not worn (in the case of clothes/armor) or wielded (polearms).
