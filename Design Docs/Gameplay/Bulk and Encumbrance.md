# Bulk and Encumbrance

* Bulk Capacity: Size Modifier + **Physical Power**

| Creature Size | Size Modifier |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Tiny          | 1             |
| Small         | 2             |
| Medium        | 4             |
| Large         | 8             |
| Huge          | 16            |
| Gargantuan    | 32            |
| Colossal      | 64            |

If a Creature is at or above it's Bulk Capacity, they gain the **Encumbered** condition. For each Multiple of their Bulk Capacity, they gain an additional level of **Encumbrance**.

| Bulk Multiplier | Size                   | Weight                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| x0              | Tiny (0.5m Cube)       | Insubstantial (<= 2 kg) |
| x1              | Small (1m Cube)        | Very Light (4 kg)       |
| x2              | Medium (2m Cube)       | Light (8 kg)            |
| x3              | Large (4m Cube)        | Normal (16 kg)          |
| x4              | Huge (6m Cube)         | Heavy (32 kg)           |
| x5              | Gargantuan (8m Cube)   | Very Heavy (64 kg)      |
| x6              | Colossal (>= 10m Cube) | Massive (>= 128 kg)     |

* To quickly estimate the Bulk of any given item, assume a default Bulk of 1. Then lookup the Bulk Multipliers by Size and Weight on the above table. Multiply these two values together to determine the approximate Bulk. As an example, an average human male falls somewhere between "Heavy" and "Very Heavy" and is size "Medium", so would have a Bulk of somewhere between 4x2 and 5x2, or 8 and 10.
* Groups of 0-bulk items become 1 bulk items. A good rule of thumb is 10 per. I.e. 10 arrows counts as 1 Bulk, 10 candles, etc.
* Certain objects, like backpacks, pouches, and the like, can offset the bulk of items they carry, allowing characters to carry additional bulk.
* Certain objects, like armor or polearms, have their Bulk reduced when equipped, as they are much more cumbersome when not worn (in the case of clothes/armor) or wielded (polearms).
