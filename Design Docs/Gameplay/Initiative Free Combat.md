# Idea: Initiative Free Combat

How to resolve combat without a formal initiative system:

1. Have everyone decide on their action. Once they decide, it's locked in. The PCs can strategize and coordinate actions together, but a turn timer (probably something like 1 or 2 minutes) should be used to reinforce the time pressure of snap decisions in frenetic combat.
2. Roll/Resolve all actions simultaneously.
	1. In cases where one action might preempt another, such as if a player is trying to shut the door to keep out an enemy, roll a Speed check. I'm envisioning Speed as a Finesse check, either Physical, Mental, or Social depending on what you're trying to do. I.e. Physical Finesse to race to slam a door or shoot off an arrow, Mental Finesse to get off a spell, Social Finesse to quickly blurt out a passphrase or argument that will stop the guard from stabbing you.
	2. Doing enough damage to knockout/kill an opponent doesn't preempt their attacks from landing (this addresses the "all my goblins died before they got off a single attack" problem, and also makes it possible for two people to take each other out simultaneously, which is fun)

| Keeps everyone engaged, instead of waiting for their turn                                                                                   | Demands continual attention                    |
| Prevents the "which ever side wins initiative pummels the other into the ground" problem of side initiative                                 | Removes the metagame options around initiative |
| Makes combat feel more like a frenetic free-for-all then a bunch of people queueing up in an orderly fashion and waiting to stab each other | More complex and nuanced adjudication          |
| Less logistical overhead                                                                                                                    |                                                |
| Removes some of the minigame-ness of combat                                                                                                 |                                                |
