# The Universal Value Scale

AKA Gold as Experience, but Better! Here TTR means Trait, Talent, and Resource Rating, and MV means Monetary Value.

NOTE: This is intended as a guide for GMs, not as a concrete law of the universe. Values can be adjusted, additional costs or requirements imposed, etc on a case by case basis. Also, this should be robust to linear scaling without affecting balance. I.E. you can probably multiply or divide a whole column by a fixed factor without necessarily breaking anything.

| TTR Point Value | MV for Permanent Access | MV per Use | Time cost for Permanent Access | Time Cost for Use |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1               | 10                      | 1          | 1 day                          | 1 hour            |
| 2               | 100                     | 10         | 1 week                         | 1 day             |
| 3               | 1,000                   | 100        | 1 month                        | 1 week            |
| 4               | 5,000                   | 500        | 3 months                       | 1 month           |
| 5               | 10,000                  | 1,000      | 6 months                       | 3 months          |
| 6               | 50,000                  | 5,000      | 1 year                         | 6 months          |
| 7               | 100,000                 | 10,000     | 2 years                        | 1 year            |
| 8               | 250,000                 | 25,000     | 5 years                        | 2 years           |
| 9               | 500,000                 | 50,000     | 10 years                       | 5 years           |
| 10              | 1,000,000               | 100,000    | 100 years                      | 10 years          |

* MV for Permanent Access: How much it costs to buy an item that can reliably grant an ability rated at that TTR; how much it costs to pay a trainer to teach you a Talent at that TTR.
* MV per Use: How much it would cost to hire a person with a talent or trait worth that TTR; pay for the casting of a spell rated at that TTR; buy a spell scroll for a spell or potion with an effect rated at that TTR
* Time Cost: How much it would cost in time to learn or acquire any of the above, in lieu of spending MV. For example, learning a talent of a certain TTR without paying a trainer, crafting or finding an item instead of purchasing one, etc. A GM can optionally use X% MV and 100 - X% Time Costs
* This can also be used to calculate the relative value of loot. For instance, rewarding 100 MV from a dungeon is equivalent to granting a Magical Sword with a TTR value of 2.
* Cumulative TTR Costs: when determining the value of say, hiring a Player Character, we add the MV per Use for each Talent, Trait, and Resource they have. So if they have 3 TTR's with rating 1, 2 TTR's with rating 2, and 1 TTR with rating 3, we add `3 x 1 + 2 x 10 + 1 x 100 = 123 MV`. We use the Time Cost per Use column of the highest TTR being paid for, in this case 3 = 1 week. So a Party Member could charge 123 MV for a week of work. A party of 4 PCs with this TTR would be worth `4 x 123 = 492 MV` per week.

Note: I'm envisioning TTR 10 as essentially god-like powers. Wish. Immortality. Apocalypse Rituals. Whereas TTR 1 powers are basically first level class features.
