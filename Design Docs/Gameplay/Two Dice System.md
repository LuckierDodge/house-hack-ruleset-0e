# Two Dice System

Any action in which success is uncertain triggers a roll. All rolls involve 2 Dice, which depend on the Character and Circumstance.

## Characteristic Die

The size of this Die is determined by the Characteristic being tested.

## Circumstance Die

* The size of this die is determined by the circumstances. Advantages, Disadvantages, Tools, Traits, and Proficiencies all contribute to the size of this die.
* By default, this die is a d6.

## Passive Tests

In some cases, a character is being tested, but not actively taking an action. In such cases, they use their Characteristic Value in place of their Characteristic Die, and the average value of the Circumstance Die they would roll for an Active Test (rounding down).

So for instance, a character's passive score for a Test with a d8 CharDie and d6 CircDie would have a Passive Score of 7.
