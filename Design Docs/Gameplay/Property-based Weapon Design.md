In this alternative weapon design system, instead of weapons being differentiated by damage die, they are distinguished purely by a set of properties which determine their functionality and capabilities.

The principle advantage of these properties is that they provide "tags" that Weapon Talents can target (i.e. a Talent might give a unique bonus to all "Blade" weapons)

## Size Based Properties

Some properties of a weapon are determined by their size relative to a wielder.

| Property    | Conditions                             | Effect                                                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light       | 2 size categories smaller than wielder | Can be dual-wielded.                                                  |
| Heavy       | Same size category as wielder          | Can't make multiple attacks in a round, disadvantage if not 2 handed. |
| Super Heavy | Larger size category than wielder      | Same as heavy, plus disadvantage on all attacks.                      |
