# Team Centered Mechanics

Ideas for mechanics that make team work the optimal strategy.

## Group Character Sheet

A group character sheet should encode resources, talents, and traits that are available to the whole group.

## Synergy

**Synergy** is a sort of "Group Inspiration". GMs should award it when the group operates well as a team or completes group goals. **Synergy** can also be gained through Downtime activities.

A player can choose to draw from the group **Synergy** pool to gain advantage on an action, so long as another member of the Group is within 6 sqs.

A party can only store **Synergy** up to the number of Player Characters in the party. Any **Synergy** gained beyond that is lost.

## Group Talents and Traits

Much like each character has Talents and Traits which encode how that character can interact with the world, each Group can have similar talents and traits, which benefit and can be employed by the whole group.

Some Group Talents require **Synergy** to use.

## Combos

Ideally, I'd like to encode combos as Emergent phenomena in gameplay, rather than explicit "push button to combo" abilities.

As an example:

* One PC spills a flask of oil on a target, which doubles the effects of Fire Damage and the Burning Condition. Another PC casts _Fire Lance_, igniting the oil.
* One PC restrains an enemy, removing their ability to Dodge so that their allies do more damage.
