# Ancestry and Culture

_RDL: Ancestry is a placeholder here, open to other suggestions_.

Idea: Ancestry and Culture as Talent Trees

Ancestry and Culture are an important part of any character. In **House Hack**, you can select traits from one or more Ancestry trees, and one or more Culture trees, representing how much of your heritage is derived from each. If you're playing in the house setting, you can use the ancestries and cultures from that setting. If you're playing in a custom world setting, ask your GM for a list of possible Ancestries and Cultures.

At Chargen, you can select 2 Ancestry Talents and 2 Culture Talents for free. You can also spend talent points/skill points on Ancestry and Culture Talents. You can select Ancestry and Culture talents from Trees you've already taken talents from at will, but should consult your GM before taking talents from new Ancestry or Culture trees.

Each Ancestry and Culture Tree is also accompanied with Aesthetic Notes, which you can choose to incorporate into your character's Aesthetic.

## Concept: Ancestries as Imprinting

- Humans are the default Ancestry. No special traits or features, literally just the assumed default.
- Because humans are naturally versatile and adaptable, they can be "imprinted" on if they spend lots of time (typically, generations) around powerful magical creatures/phenomenon.
- For example, perhaps True Elves in this world are fantastical nature spirits, more akin to Dryads and Nymphs than D&D elves. Human cultures that spent lots of time around True Elves begin to take on Elven characteristics. These "imprinted" humans are like the Tolkien-ian elves we know and love.
- You can't normally play as a True Elf/Dwarf/Demon/Dragon/Angel/whatever
- How is this represented mechanically? As a Talent Tree! Stronger imprints are represented by you taking more talents from the appropriate Talent Tree.
- The expression of Magical Imprinting can evolve over time, allowing you to take more Talents from the Tree as your character advances (or even talents from new Ancestral Talent Trees. For instance, maybe your character gets a Dragon blood transfusion, and now you can start taking Dragonkin talents). You can also potentially have more than one Imprint influencing you. Perhaps you come from a line of Elves on one side and Demonkin on the other? Mix and match from the Talent Trees to find the appropriate expression of those two lineages.
- This also makes balance easier, as anything you invest in Ancestral Talents isn't being invested in Background/Class Talents. This is a little reminiscent of 3.5e's Racial Level adjustment stuff, but more emergent and less...cludgy.
- Theoretically, you could also reuse these talent trees for NPC/Creature stat blocks, e.g. turn any Human statblock into the True Elf equivalent by simply adding a bunch of Talents from the Elven Ancestry talent tree.
> A very interesting concept! I enjoy the potential for customization and the fun lore. It could also be adapted for sci-fi settings with either magic or gene editing.

> A slight issue I have is the only option being fundamentally "human". Though I personally feel as though I could adapt my attitude to fit the aesthetic, I feel as though playing non-human races are a big lure for many people who play rpgs. May I suggest a more flexible imprinting approach: There are several base races (human, elf, dwarf, etc) who are all capable of imprinting if exposed for other cultures for long enough. I like the idea of a mostly uncharacterized, default race, but I personally think humans should still have their own distinct culture. Maybe have a 'cosmopolitan' race created from the union of all of the different cultures coming together in one place.

> But yeah, I do really like this. I will say that with all of the skill trees we are planning for, we may want to consider pre-made templates as sort of a recommendation for beginners. Then show the rest of the trees for those of us ever obsessed with micro-customizing builds.
