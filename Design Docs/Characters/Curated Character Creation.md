# Curated Character Creation

A Curated Character Creation system provides a guided experience for creating characters. This will generally take the form of a series of Rollable tables.

Goals:

1. Manage Analysis Paralysis by creating a series of decisions with a handful of available options each
2. Allow for quick character creation
3. Prompt backstory/character hooks
4. Mitigate Min-maxing shenanigans

Note:

* I refer to TTR Points a couple times here. This stands for Trait, Talent, and Resource Points, and is a bad name for which I would love some alternatives suggested.
* All of the numbers here are fuzzy, and will need to be adjusted for balance.
* Any of the Tables below can be swapped out for alternatives when making characters for a specific Module, Setting, Campaign, or Game. (This is also how homebrew options can be included)
* GMs might allow experienced players to select ala carte, though I think this is probably a bad idea. Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of the game and all that.
* Optionally, GMs can allow a certain number of Mulligans. A Mulligan can be used by a player to reroll a single roll of their choice at any point during the Curated Character Creation process. 1-3 of these is probably about the right amount, depending on TTR Budget.

> RDL: There's a really cool version of this which I can kind of picture in my head that works on a "Deck Builder" system, where you draw cards and use them to build a "Deck" of TTR Points. I really like the idea, but I feel like a Deck of Cards is kind of impractical and hard for GMs to modify to suite their needs. Could be cool though.

## 1. Trait, Talent, and Resource (TTR) Budget

This is essentially equivalent to "Starting Level" in 5e, and should be determined by the Player's and GM before beginning Character Creation. All characters should generally start at the same TTR Budget. Basically, this determines how many Talents and Traits a character will have selected after completing character creation. This will probably have a minimum viable value.

## 2. Origin

### 2.1 Ancestry

First roll to determine your Ancestry using the Ancestry Influences Table.

| 1d100  | Ancestral Influences                                                                                                                    |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-50   | Fully Human, Move on to Step 2.2                                                                                                        |
| 51-80  | Imprinted by a Single Ancestry; Roll 3 times on the Ancestries table and choose one as your Imprinted Ancestry                          |
| 81-90  | Imprinted on by 2 Distinct Ancestries; Roll 4 times on the Ancestries table and choose two as your Imprinted Ancestries                 |
| 91-100 | "True" Ancestry. Roll 3 times on the Ancestries table and choose one as your True Ancestry. You gain all Traits marked as "True Traits" |

For each Imprinted Ancestry, take (one of) the starting Trait(s) from that Ancestry Trait Tree.

### 2.2 Culture

Roll on the "Number of Distinct Cultural Influences" table to determine how many different Culture Trait Trees you can draw from.

| 1d100  | Number of Distinct Cultural Influences                                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-10   | 0; You were an outsider, hermit, or otherwise sufficiently independent of any strong Cultural Influence |
| 11-75  | 1; You developed in a single strong Cultural Milieu                                                     |
| 76-90  | 2; You developed between two worlds, influenced by both                                                 |
| 91-100 | 3; You developed in a complicated or cosmopolitan Cultural Environment                                                                                                       |

If you have at least 1 Cultural Influence, roll 2 + "Number of Cultural Influences" times on the Cultures Table and choose a number of Culture Trait Trees equal to the amount of Cultural Influences you rolled above. For each Culture, take (one of) the starting Trait(s) from each Culture Trait Tree.

### 2.3 Flesh Out Origin

Before proceeding to the "Life Experience" section, you can choose to select additional Ancestry or Cultural Traits from the Ancestry and Culture Trees that you have selected. You can select as many traits as you would like, so long as you don't have more Traits selected than your character's TTR Budget - 2.

## 3. Life Experience

To finish creating your Character, use the Life Experience table below until all of your TTR Points are allocated. To do so, do the following:

1. Roll twice on the Life Experience Table, rerolling duplicates. Choose one.
	1. If one of the options would cause you to exceed your TTR Budget, you may discard previous Life Experiences to take that option.
	2. Unless marked Unique, you may select a Life Experience multiple times. This can represent either a longer and more impactful experience (e.g., serving the same tour of duty as a Soldier for multiple years), or two different instances of the same experience (e.g., serving as a soldier in two separate campaigns, separated by other Life Experience)
4. Repeat until you reach your TTR Budget.

| 1d100 | Unique | Life Experience                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     |        | You were a Soldier who served in a war. Gain a Martial Talent.                                                                                                                 |
| 2     |        | You apprenticed under a Master Tradesperson. Gain a Trade Talent.                                                                                                              |
| 3     |        | You studied the ways of Magic in a University or under the tutelage of a powerful Wizard. Gain an Arcane Talent.                                                               |
| 4     |        | You were born into a noble family. Gain a Talent from the Noble Talent Tree.                                                                                                   |
| 5     |        | You have been touched by the Divine, either in a moment of Apotheosis or through years of Seminary or Monastic dedication. Gain a Divine Talent.                               |
| …     |        | …                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 97    | ✅     | You inherited or came into possession of a powerful Magical Artifact. Roll on the Magical Artifact Table (Presumably, each Artifact would have a corresponding TTR Point cost) |
| 98    |        | You inherited or came into a great deal of wealth. Roll up to 4 times on the Wealth Table. (Presumably, an amount of wealth would have a corresponding TTR Point cost)         |
| 99    | ✅     | An encounter, arrangement, or experiment resulted in your blood being imbued with the power of a Dragon. Gain a Draconic Ancestry Trait                                        |
| 100   | ✅     | You made a pact with a Fiend for access to dark power. Gain a Talent from the Devil Pact Talent Tree.                                                                          |

Whenever an experience directs you to "Gain a ___ Talent", do the following:

1. If you have no Talents from the corresponding Talent Group, roll twice on that Talent Group Table and choose one Talent Tree to gain (one of) the starting Talent(s) from. For example, if you are directed to gain a "Martial Talent" for the first time, roll twice on the "Martial Talent Group" table and choose one result.
2. If you already have talents from one Talent Tree in a Talent Group, you can choose to either gain a talent from that Talent Tree, or roll for a second Talent Tree as in step 1.
3. If you already have talents from 2 Talent Trees in a Talent Group, you may select a talent from either Talent Tree, but may not roll for any additional Talent Trees.

Once you've allocated all of your Life Experiences, you can use it to help weave your backstory. Note that your Life Experiences may occur in any order that makes sense, and can overlap.
