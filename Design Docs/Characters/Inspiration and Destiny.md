# Inspiration

* When a Creature Critically Succeeds, they can choose one ally to grant advantage on their next roll.
* Alternatively, they can impose Disadvantage on one Enemy's next roll.
* Witnessing an ally excel makes it more likely for you to excel in turn, and witnessing an enemy excel can distract and dispirit you.

# Destiny

* You choose a Destiny at character creation, or have the option to pick/change destiny later on. 
* A character with a Destiny is forever being guided by it, pulled by the forces of fate towards their role in the cosmic weave, and when they attempt an action that brings them closer to it they get Advantage on that roll.
* If they take an action to fight their destiny, they get Disadvantage on an associated roll.
