# Supernatural Power

Characters who take levels in the Caster class, descend from certain Fantastic Ancestry, or discover powerful items and artifacts during their adventures can wield Supernatural Powers, such as Magic, Divine Miracles, or Psionic Powers. Such powers have their own unique rules and behaviors, but there are some commonalities between them.

## Casting

In order to "cast" these powers--be they spells, miracles, psionic abilites, or something else--a character typically needs to know three things:

* Their Casting Characteristic
* Their Casting Skill Rank
* Their Fuel source

In the case of powers granted from the Caster class, these are determined by their chosen Subclass. For instance, Mages use their Wits, Arcane Magic Skill, and Aether as their Fuel source.

Casting powers typically consumes fuel and requires a Test against the appropriate Casting Skill and Characteristic. At the GM's discretion, if there is no threat or urgency, a Power may be cast with reduced or no Fuel cost, and/or without the Test (in keeping with the rule that tests should only be made when there is a reasonable chance of failure). While igniting a ravenous Goblin in the heat of combat takes precise aim and can be taxing on a Mage's reserves, igniting a few logs to start a campfire for the night can be done at leisure just using the latent magic in the air.

## Casting for Non-Casters

Sometimes, a character who is not normally a Caster finds themselves in a situation where they must cast a power. This often happens with the aid of magic items, spell scrolls, or the like. In such cases, the item's description should specify the relevant Characteristic, Skill, and Fuel, but if not, the GM should make an appropriate ruling. If the character does not have the relevant skill, they treat it like any other untrained skill, adding a +0 to their target.
