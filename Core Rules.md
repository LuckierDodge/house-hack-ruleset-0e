# Core Mechanics

## Tests

* This is a 1d20 Roll Under system.
* Advantage: For each advantage, roll an additional die and take the best result
* Disadvantage: For each disadvantage, roll an additional die and take the worst result
* Advantages and Disadvantages cancel 1:1
* Difficulty: 
	* Some challenges in the world are more or less difficult than the normal tests a character would face. When facing these challenges a GM should adjust the target number accordingly.

## Characteristics

* Vigor: feats of strength or endurance, weapon damage, health, stamina
* Finesse: sleight of hand, lock picking, tools, stealth, weapon attacks
* Agility: acrobatics, dodging, speed
* Wits: knowledge, spell casting, perception, argument
* Will: stamina, spell casting, argument, mental defense

## Skills

* Having Skill Ranks in a Skill grants a bonus to the target number for tests related to that skill.
* If multiple skills are relevant to a check, pick the highest to use.
* Specializations:
	* Some skills have specializations. For these skills, ranks are invested in the sub-skills. If a specific specialization applies, use the rank for that specialization. Otherwise, use the rank of the skill as a whole. The skill's rank is equal to the highest rank of it's specializations
* A character's maximum rank in a given skill is equal to their Character Level.

## Destiny (Optional Rule)

* During Character Creation or at the GM's discretion, a character may choose a Destiny for their Character
* Whenever the GM determines the character has made significant progress towards their Destiny, they gain a Destiny point.
* Destiny points can be spent by the player to change the value of a single die result to a value of their choosing.
* Each Character can only have a single Destiny Point at a time.

## Inspiration

* When a character critically succeeds, they can inspire one ally that can see and/or hear the character, granting them Advantage on their next roll.

## Luck (Optional Rule)

Characters have a Luck score, which they can elect to use in place of another Characteristic when tested. The first time they do so after a Rest or Interlude, roll a d20 to determine their current Luck Score. After resolving a test using a Character's Luck score, reduce their current Luck score by 1.
