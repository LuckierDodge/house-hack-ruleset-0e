# Core Mechanics

## Tests

* This is a 1d20 Roll Under system.
* Advantage: For each advantage, roll an additional die and take the best result
* Disadvantage: For each disadvantage, roll an additional die and take the worst result
* Advantages and Disadvantages cancel 1:1
* Difficulty:
	* Some challenges in the world are more or less difficult than the normal tests a character would face. When facing these challenges a GM should adjust the target number accordingly.

## Characteristics

* Vigor: feats of strength or endurance, weapon damage, health, stamina
* Finesse: sleight of hand, lock picking, tools, stealth, weapon attacks
* Agility: acrobatics, dodging, speed
* Wits: knowledge, spell casting, perception, argument
* Will: stamina, spell casting, argument, mental defense

## Skills

* Having Skill Ranks in a Skill grants a bonus to the target number for tests related to that skill.
* If multiple skills are relevant to a check, pick the highest to use.
* Specializations:
	* Some skills have specializations. For these skills, ranks are invested in the sub-skills. If a specific specialization applies, use the rank for that specialization. Otherwise, use the rank of the skill as a whole. The skill's rank is equal to the highest rank of it's specializations
* Character's start with a Maximum Rank for any Skill of 2. This increases as they level.

## Destiny (Optional Rule)

* During Character Creation or at the GM's discretion, a character may choose a Destiny for their Character
* Whenever the GM determines the character has made significant progress towards their Destiny, they gain a Destiny point.
* Destiny points can be spent by the player to change the value of a single die result to a value of their choosing.
* Each Character can only have a single Destiny Point at a time.

## Inspiration

* When a character critically succeeds, they can inspire one ally that can see and/or hear the character, granting them Advantage on their next roll.

## Luck (Optional Rule)

Characters have a Luck score, which they can elect to use in place of another Characteristic when tested. The first time they do so after a Rest or Interlude, roll a d20 to determine their current Luck Score. After resolving a test using a Character's Luck score, reduce their current Luck score by 1.

## Negotiation and Persuasion

* When you are attempting to persuade someone or negotiate with another Character, you choose an Argument, either Logos, Pathos, or Ethos.
* This determines the Characteristic used when you make your Test, and the Characteristic used by the other Character to Defend.
* You may add a relevant Skill rank, depending on your approach
	* For instance, you can add Deception if lying or manipulating, or Intimidation if appropriate.
* The GM sets 3 numbers: Difficulty, Progress, and Patience.
	* Difficulty (1 to 3): how much Progress is needed before the target is convinced.
	* Progress (typically starts at 0): how convinced the target is or isn't. Can be started at negative or positive depending on the targets receptiveness.
	* Patience (-1 to -3): how much Progress must be lost before the target is fed up and won't listen to further arguments.
* If the Progress equals the Difficulty before the Patience, or the Patience reaches 0, the character is convinced by your arguments. If it reaches their Patience or their Patience reaches 0, they are unconvinced and unwilling to listen to further arguments.
* Examples
	* Negotiating a Price Cut with an Amiable Shopkeeper: Difficulty 1, Patience 2
	* Negotiating Mercy from an Evil Dragon: Difficulty 3, Patience 1
	* Negotiating favorable terms in a Trade Deal with the Ambassadors of a self-interested kingdom: Difficulty 3, Patience 3
