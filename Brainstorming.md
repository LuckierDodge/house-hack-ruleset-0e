# Brainstorming


## Ryan's Design Goals

1. Easy to hack: can easily create new character features/monsters/items/systems with some level of confidence that you won't completely break your game.
2. Mechanical Depth and Tactical Combat, but keep it streamlined. No 3 page grappling rules
3. Emphasis on Party Teamwork
4. Easy Action Resolution: make it easy for the GM to adjudicate action resolution without having to rely too heavily on referencing the rules.
