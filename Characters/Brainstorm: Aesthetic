# Character Aesthetic

A character mechanic loosely meant to be a mediator between mechanical rules and social encounters. Character aesthetic describes how a character portrays themselves to the world. Loosely related to D&D's character background, Aesthetic incorporates character appearance, mannerisms, social connections, and to some extend combat style. 

## Roleplaying implications
The first goal of aesthetic is to help players establish who their character is to themselves and the other players. This does not mean a player must roleplay their character as a stereotype, but it does give a frame of reference for initial judgements that players can then play into or against. 

## Social connections

## Combat Style
Sometimes, rpg combat mechanics make it difficult to balance optimization with individual tastes. Like in real life, some weapon combinations end up better than others. But games are make-believe, and I want my character to wield weapons that would be horribly ineffective in reality. Aesthetic is meant to provide some mechanical leverage to allow a better balance of character style and mechanical optimization.
