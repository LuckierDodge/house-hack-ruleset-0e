# Ancestry and Culture

_RDL: Ancestry is a placeholder here, open to other suggestions_.

Idea: Ancestry and Culture as Talent Trees

Ancestry and Culture are an important part of any character. In **House Hack**, you can select traits from one or more Ancestry trees, and one or more Culture trees, representing how much of your heritage is derived from each. If you're playing in the house setting, you can use the ancestries and cultures from that setting. If you're playing in a custom world setting, ask your GM for a list of possible Ancestries and Cultures.

At Chargen, you can select 2 Ancestry Talents and 2 Culture Talents for free. You can also spend talent points/skill points on Ancestry and Culture Talents. You can select Ancestry and Culture talents from Trees you've already taken talents from at will, but should consult your GM before taking talents from new Ancestry or Culture trees.

Each Ancestry and Culture Tree is also accompanied with Aesthetic Notes, which you can choose to incorporate into your character's Aesthetic.
