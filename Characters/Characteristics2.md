# Matthew's Suggestion for Characteristics

### Physical Characteristics
* Physicality: Physical strength. Governs atheticism, lifting capacity, the damage of heavier weapons such as maces, axes, swords, and longbows, etc. 
* Finesse: Physical agility and precision. Governs stealth, nimbleness, and the accuracy of weapons such as swords, spears, knives, crossbows, etc. 
* Fortitude: Resistance and recovery speed against physical ailments. Partially contributes to hp. 

### Mental Characteristics
* Memory: The ability to recall previously learned information and concentrate on multiple things at once. Important for memorization spellcasters.
* Intuition: The ability to instinctively pick up on important details, particularly in regards to other living beings. Important for intuitive spellcasters. Slight overlap with Reasoning, but more passive and more prone to magical deception.
* Reasoning: The ability to analyze information, learn new concepts, and predict events. Important for conceptual spellscasters. Slight overlap with Intuition, but more active and more prone to charismatic deception. 
* Willpower: Resistance and recovery speed from mental ailments. Partially contributes to hp. Important for will spellcasters
* Personality: Manipulating others through social interaction. 

### Explanation for why I exclude Senses as an attribute
I would argue that much of what "sensing" or "perceiving" within the context of a TTRPG implicitly incorporates the skills of intuition and/or reasoning. Whenever a player tries to sense or perceive the world around them in general, the dm can only describe so much information. Naturally, higher rolls tend to amount to the dm giving just the "important" information as opposed to more information. But filtering out significant information is the entire point of intuition and reasoning. Instead of "sensing", I propose intuition and reasoning to be the main skills for gathering information. Instead of weirdly sharp senses explaining the process of noticing small or hidden details, it is instead explained by using intuition or reason to filter out unimportant information to leave nothing except the important details. This way is much more conhesive with how dms provide information.
