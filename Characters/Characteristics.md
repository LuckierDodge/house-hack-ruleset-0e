# Characteristics

| Physical           | Mental             |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Physicality (PHYS) | Wits (WITS)        |
| Fortitude (FORT)   | Will (WILL)        |
| Finesse (FINE)     | Personality (PERS) |
| Senses (SENS)      | Senses (SENS)      |

* Senses are both a Physical and a Mental Characteristic, and are affected by any effect that targets Physical or Mental Characteristics, unless otherwise noted.

## Matthew's Suggestion for Characteristics

### Physical Characteristics

* Physicality: Physical strength. Governs atheticism, lifting capacity, the damage of heavier weapons such as maces, axes, swords, and longbows, etc.
* Finesse: Physical agility and precision. Governs stealth, nimbleness, and the accuracy of weapons such as swords, spears, knives, crossbows, etc.
* Fortitude: Resistance and recovery speed against physical ailments. Partially contributes to hp.

### Mental Characteristics

* Memory: The ability to recall previously learned information and concentrate on multiple things at once. Important for memorization spellcasters.
* Intuition: The ability to instinctively pick up on important details, particularly in regards to other living beings. Important for intuitive spellcasters. Slight overlap with Reasoning, but more passive and more prone to magical deception.
* Reasoning: The ability to analyze information, learn new concepts, and predict events. Important for conceptual spellscasters. Slight overlap with Intuition, but more active and more prone to charismatic deception.
* Willpower: Resistance and recovery speed from mental ailments. Partially contributes to hp. Important for will spellcasters
* Personality: Manipulating others through social interaction.

### Explanation for Why I Exclude Senses as an Attribute

I would argue that much of what "sensing" or "perceiving" within the context of a TTRPG implicitly incorporates the skills of intuition and/or reasoning. Whenever a player tries to sense or perceive the world around them in general, the dm can only describe so much information. Naturally, higher rolls tend to amount to the dm giving just the "important" information as opposed to more information. But filtering out significant information is the entire point of intuition and reasoning. Instead of "sensing", I propose intuition and reasoning to be the main skills for gathering information. Instead of weirdly sharp senses explaining the process of noticing small or hidden details, it is instead explained by using intuition or reason to filter out unimportant information to leave nothing except the important details. This way is much more conhesive with how dms provide information.

## Characteristics as Dimensions

Rather than having defined characteristics, it might be interesting to imagine characteristics as dimensions.

* Distribute a +2, +1, and +0 between Physical, Mental, and Social
* Distribute a +2, +1, and +0 between Power, Finesse, and Resilience
* Some characters gain (Arcane) or (Divine), through magical aptitude or divine favor.

| Example Mage | Power +0 | Finesse +2 | Resilience +1 |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Physical +0  | +0       | +2         | +1            |
| Mental +2    | +2       | +4         | +3            |
| Social +1    | +1       | +3         | +2            |
| (Arcane +1)  | +1       | +3         | +2            |
| (Divine -)   | -        | -          | -             |

| Example Fighter | Power +2 | Finesse +0 | Resilience +1 |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Physical +2     | +4       | +2         | +3            |
| Mental +1       | +3       | +1         | +2            |
| Social +0       | +2       | +0         | +1            |
| (Arcane -)      | -        | -          | -             |
| (Divine -)      | -        | -          | -             |

| Example Cleric | Power +0 | Finesse +1 | Resilience +2 |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Physical +0    | +0       | +1         | +2            |
| Mental +1      | +1       | +2         | +3            |
| Social +2      | +2       | +3         | +4            |
| (Arcane -)     | -        | -          | -             |
| (Divine +1)    | +1       | +2         | +3            |

In such a system, we can pretty quickly classify any action and determine the relevant modifiers.

* Swinging a Great Sword? Physical + Power
* Shooting a Bow and Arrow? Physical + Finesse
* Perception? Mental + Finesse
* Picking a lock? Physical + Finesse.
* Calling on your God to help you divine the best course of action? Divine + Finesse.
* Intimidation check? Physical + Power vs. Social + Resilience.
* Casting a Fireball? Arcane + Power
* Trying to figure out how to set a broken bone? Mental + Finesse
* Trying to heal it with magic? Arcane + Finesse
* Channeling your god to miraculously heal it? Divine + Finesse
* Using your magic to deflect a blade? Arcane + Resilience

> oooooh, I love this concept. This is a very fun way to organize attributes. I also appreciate the separation of mental from social. I've been finding the wisdom - intelligence split difficult to separate mechanically, but charisma can definitely be distinct.
> 
> As for critiques, I'm not sure I quite like how the column bonuses work. I can understand why improving one physical trait would most likely improve others (to some extent), but I struggle with how becoming more physically powerful will also make you mentally and socially powerful. Our stat increase system might need to be slightly more robust.
> 
> I am also a little hazy with how to precisely categorize an action with an attribute intersection. Is reading a person's facial expression mental, or social? What is the difference between mental power and mental finesse? And admittedly, I am not sold on having a separate spellcasting attribute. I kind of like having it attached to standard attributes to help define the magic.
> 
> Overall, I really like it! It is a good start for a cool, unique system.
