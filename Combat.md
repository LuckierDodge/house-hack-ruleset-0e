# Combat, Action, and Danger

## Actions

* At the start of each round, each player character rolls a Speed Check (TN: 10 + Agility + Speed Skill Rank). Characters that succeed act before NPCs, characters that fail act afterwards.
* Surprised player characters make speed checks with disadvantage. Surprised NPCs act last.
* Each character can take 1 action and move on their turn. Once per round, a character can spend Stamina to take an additional action.
* A character can use their actions to move, attack, interact with the environment, or anything else they can reasonably undertake in 6-10 seconds.

## Movement

* A character can spend an action to move a number of Units (~1.5 meters or ~5 feet) equal to their Base Movement (3 units, for most Characters)
* Characters get 1 free move action per round.

## Attack and Defense

* When attacking, roll under 10 + Finesse + Weapon Skill Rank
* If a character has an available action (or can spend a Stamina to gain one), they can immediately expend it to take the Defend action:
	* Dodge: 10 + Agility + Dodge Skill
	* Shield Block: 10 + Finesse + Shield Rating
	* Parry: 10 + Finesse + Parry Skill Rank
* You can also spend an action (if available) to immediately Counter Attack
	* Counter Attack: 10 + Finesse + Weapon Skill Rank
* A character who hasn't acted yet can respond to an attack by both Defending and spending a Stamina to Counter Attack
* Weapon Damage: Vigor + Weapon Base Damage (minimum 1)
* Crits do double damage

| Weapon Size | Weapon Base Damage |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Unarmed     | 0                  |
| Small       | 1                  |
| Medium      | 2                  |
| Large       | 3                  |
| Very Large  | 4                  |

* Subsequent attacks with the same weapon in a round accrue an additional Disadvantage.
* Reducing Damage: Armor, Wards, and Resistances provide Damage Reduction, which reduces the damage of a successful hit by the corresponding amount.

## Health, Stamina, and Reserves

* Characters start with a Health Pool equal to their Hit Die + Vigor (Minimum 1).
* You have a Stamina Pool equal to 1 + Vigor + Will (Minimum 1).
* You have Reserves equal to your 1 + Vigor + Will (Minimum 1).
* Stamina can be spent at any time to gain the benefits of certain Talents.
	* Stamina and Health can be negative. Each negative point of Health or Stamina applies a level of Exhaustion (-1 to all rolls and defenses for each level, other than Death's Door Checks, see below).
	* At 5 Exhaustion, your character is at Death's Door.
* Reserves can only be spent during a Rest (8 hours of sleep) or Interlude (1 or more days spent in a safe location), and can be used for the following:
	* You can spend 1 Reserve to recover 1d4 Stamina.
	* You can spend 1 Reserve to regain a Hit Die worth of Health
* You regain 1 Reserve per day during an Interlude

### Death's Door

* If you reach 5 Exhaustion, you are at Death's Door.
* While at Death's Door, you are unable to stand and can only crawl 1 unit or take a single action.
* Death's Door Check: roll under 10 + Greater of Vigor or Will.
* Every time you gain additional Exhaustion while at Death's Door, roll a new Death's Door Check. On your first failure, you fall unconscious (unable to move or take actions). On your second failure, you die.
