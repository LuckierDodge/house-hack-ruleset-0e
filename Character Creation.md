# Creating Your Character

Use the following procedure to create a 1st level Character in House Hack 0e.

## Ancestry

Before anything else, your character is born a descendant of one of the many Ancestries that inhabit the world.

You can choose to play a Human, or, at your GM's discretion, select a Fantastic Ancestry. Your GM might have you roll on a table, or simply select an ancestry from a curated list of options.

You gain the starting features of the Ancestry you select.

### Example Ancestry Table
