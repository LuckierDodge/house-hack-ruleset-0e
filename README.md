A hacked together ruleset for running your own Fantasy RPG, presented without warranty. Use at your own risk!

## Design Statement

> The goal is to have a system that is lightweight, fast-paced, and easily hackable, with a focus on presenting players with interesting, tactical, and meaningful choices, and giving GM's a toolkit to easily build their own settings, campaigns, adventures, encounters, NPCs, character options, etc.
