# House Hack 0e

A hacked together ruleset for running your own Fantasy RPG, presented without warranty. Use at your own risk!

## Design Statement

> The goal is to have a system that is lightweight and easily hackable, with a focus on presenting players with interesting, tactical, and meaningful choices, and giving GM's a toolkit to easily build their own settings, campaigns, adventures, encounters, NPCs, character options, etc.

## High-Level Overview

* House Hack is a d20 Roll Under system with a focus on a small set of Core Characteristics and a large collection of Skills and Talents that allow characters to specialize.
* House Hack has three broad core classes
	* Warrior
	* Master
	* Caster
* Each class has a number of Talent Trees and, in the case of Caster, sub classes that further define a character's capabilities and role.
* Much of the current "content" is barebones, essentially acting as placeholders and prototypes to eyeball the system's chassis against.
